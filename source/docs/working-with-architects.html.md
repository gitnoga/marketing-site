# Working with Architects

## The Blueprint

Describe what the blueprint is, and how we start off every project on
them.

### Design and Research

Describe the design and research process and the benefits of it.

### Prototypes and Proofs of Concept Development

Describe how we use prototype and proofs of concept to uncover any
hidden complexities or edge cases, or to illuminate a path forward for
building something which has not yet been done.

### Product Roadmap

Describe the final product of the blueprint phase, which is an
interactive product roadmap that follows the project from the design
phase all the way until the release. 

## Developing a minimum viable product

Describe how we use the blueprint to develop a minimum viable release,
how we launch that product, and begin measuring how it performs, so we
can begin refining it and perfecting it.

## Iterative Design and Development

Describe how we can use the Blueprint to develop testable hypotheses
about ways to improve the design and implementation. 

- Hypotheses
- Test & Measure
- Reflect & Repeat
