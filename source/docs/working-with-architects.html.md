# Working with Architects

## The Blueprint

The Architects.io Project Blueprint is an interactive document that is used to support large software and design efforts. It does so by capturing all of the necessary domain knowledge, along with the vision, goals and strategy for the product, and links these with the Product Roadmap in our Application Lifecycle Management tool.

The Architects.io Project Blueprint is all encompassing. Product teams consisting of architects, developers, and designers rely on the blueprint to provide them with the specifications and goals for their work product, and to help prioritize different aspects of the delivery cycle. Business stakeholders and project managers rely on the blueprint as a live status report, as a scope of work, and as a tool for projecting completion times and costs. Quality assurance and testing teams rely on the Blueprint's set of automated integration tests to guarantee that the software performs as agreed, free of errors and mistakes.

A typical software development project done on the Architects.io Blueprint model consists of four phases:

1) Blueprint Design and Research 
2) Product Roadmap containing feature specifications, acceptance criteria, estimates, financial projections 
3) Minimium Viable Release
4) Iterative release cycle to build upon and refine the Minimum Viable Release



### Design and Research

In this phase, we set out to learn and document as much as possible about the domain, the people who will be using the software, what their goals are, and especially what are the different constraints this software will have imposed on it.

Depending on the time and budget constraints, there are a variety of different processes and approaches we can take, but ultimately our goal is to arrive at the most specific possible description of the software in as much detail as possible. We aim to learn, test, and refine as much as we can so that we discover hidden complexities, hidden assumptions, and things of this nature before we begin developing the software.

At the end of this phase, clients will receive a Blueprint document that contains:



### Prototypes and Proofs of Concept Development

Describe how we use prototype and proofs of concept to uncover any
hidden complexities or edge cases, or to illuminate a path forward for
building something which has not yet been done.

### Product Roadmap

At the end of the Blueprint phase one, clients will receive a Product Roadmap. A Product Roadmap is an extremely detailed, and substantiated collection of specifications for every part of the software that can be used as a suitable basis for an RFP phase to receive fixed cost, fixed timeline proposals to complete the project.

In addition to this, all of the necessary collateral and assets to complete the project, as discovered in Phase 1, are either attached to the roadmap in their completed form, or as links to the project management page for that dependency so that implementation teams can be notified as they become available.

The Product Roadmap includes estimates from which release timelines can be projected based on the expected levels of resources that are available to the project.

At this point it is the Client's decision if they would like to take their Blueprint to another development team or if they would like to engage with Architects' teams of development professionals.

## Developing a minimum viable product

For projects which make it past the Blueprinting phase, the blueprint gets imported into our Application Lifecycle Management tool which helps coordinate all of our software releases and deployments.

The very first phase of development will consist of the bare minimum amount of modules and features that can be used to conduct meaningful beta tests with real users and test users of the software.

Describe how we use the blueprint to develop a minimum viable release,
how we launch that product, and begin measuring how it performs, so we
can begin refining it and perfecting it.

## Iterative Design and Development

Describe how we can use the Blueprint to develop testable hypotheses
about ways to improve the design and implementation.

- Test & Measure
- Reflect & Repeat
